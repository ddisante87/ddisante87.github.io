	abstract = {Optical spectroscopy of ultimately thin materials has significantly enhanced our understanding of collective excitations in low-dimensional semiconductors. This is particularly reflected by the rich physics of excitons in atomically thin crystals which uniquely arises from the interplay of strong Coulomb correlation, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and lattice geometry. Here we extend the field by reporting the observation of room temperature excitons in a material of non-trivial global topology. We study the fundamental optical excitation spectrum of a single layer of bismuth atoms epitaxially grown on a SiC substrate (hereafter bismuthene or Bi/SiC) which has been established as a large-gap, two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator. Strongly developed optical resonances are observed to emerge around the direct gap at the K and K’ points of the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of bound excitons with considerable oscillator strength. These experimental findings are corroborated, concerning both the character of the excitonic resonances as well as their energy scale, by ab-initio GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations, confirming strong Coulomb interaction effects in these optical excitations. Our observations provide evidence of excitons in a 2D QSH insulator at room temperature, with excitonic and topological physics deriving from the very same electronic structure.},

We demonstrate that a deep learning architecture based on a neural ordinary differential equation solver in a low-dimensional latent space efficiently learns the FRG dynamics that delineates the various magnetic and d-wave superconducting regimes of the Hubbard model. We further present a dynamic mode decomposition analysis that confirms that a small number of modes are indeed sufficient to capture the FRG dynamics.

	abstract = {The layered vanadium antimonides AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) are a recently discovered family of topological kagome metals that exhibit a range of strongly correlated electronic phases including charge order and superconductivity. However, it is not yet understood how the distinctive electronic structure of the kagome lattice is linked to the observed many-body phenomena. Here we combine angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory to reveal multiple kagome-derived van Hove singularities (vHS) coexisting near the Fermi level of CsV3Sb5 and analyse their contribution to electronic symmetry breaking. The vHS are characterized by two distinct sublattice flavours (p-type and m-type), which originate, respectively, from their pure and mixed sublattice characters. These twofold vHS flavours of the kagome lattice critically determine the pairing symmetry and unconventional ground states emerging in the AV3Sb5 series. We establish that, among the multiple vHS in CsV3Sb5, the m-type vHS of the dxz/dyz kagome band and the p-type vHS of the dxy/dx2–y2 kagome band are located very close to the Fermi level, setting the stage for electronic symmetry breaking. The former band is characterized by pronounced Fermi surface nesting, while the latter exhibits a higher-order vHS. Our work reveals the essential role of kagome-derived vHS for the collective phenomena realized in the AV3Sb5 family.},

Recently, the onset of superconductivity at 4.7 K has been reported in the hole-doped triangular lattice of tin atoms on a silicon substrate. Through renormalization group methods designed for weak and intermediate coupling, we investigate the nature of the superconducting instability in hole-doped Sn=Sið111Þ. We find that the extended Hubbard nature of interactions is crucial to yield triplet pairing, which is f-wave (p-wave) for moderate (higher) hole doping.

We show that the sublattice interference mechanism is central to understanding the formation of superconductivity in a kagome metal. Starting from an appropriately chosen minimal tight-binding model with multiple van Hove singularities close to the Fermi level for AV3Sb5, we provide a random phase approximation analysis of superconducting instabilities. Nonlocal Coulomb repulsion, the sublattice profile of the van Hove bands, and the interaction strength turn out to be the crucial parameters to determine the preferred pairing symmetry. Implications for potentially topological surface states are discussed, along with a proposal for additional measurements to pin down the nature of superconductivity in AV3Sb5.},

	abstract = {A current challenge in condensed matter physics is the realization of strongly correlated, viscous electron fluids. These fluids can be described by holography, that is, by mapping them onto a weakly curved gravitational theory via gauge/gravity duality. The canonical system considered for realizations has been graphene. In this work, we show that Kagome systems with electron fillings adjusted to the Dirac nodes provide a much more compelling platform for realizations of viscous electron fluids, including non-linear effects such as turbulence. In particular, we find that in Scandium Herbertsmithite, the fine-structure constant, which measures the effective Coulomb interaction, is enhanced by a factor of about 3.2 as compared to graphene. We employ holography to estimate the ratio of the shear viscosity over the entropy density in Sc-Herbertsmithite, and find it about three times smaller than in graphene. These findings put the turbulent flow regime described by holography within the reach of experiments. Viscous electron fluids are predicted in strongly correlated systems but remain challenging to realize. Here, the authors predict enhanced effective Coulomb interaction and reduced ratio of the shear viscosity over entropy density in a Kagome metal, inferring turbulent flow of viscous electron fluids.},

Contrary to the expected conservation of the perovskite stacking order in the (001) direction, heteroepitaxially grown SrIrO3 films on TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 are found to exhibit a terminating SrO surface layer. The proposed mechanism for the self-organized conversion involves the adsorption of excess oxygen ions at the apical sites of the IrO2-terminated surface and the subsequent decomposition of the IrO6 octahedra into gaseous molecular IrO3 and the remaining SrO-terminated surface. Whereas the ab initio calculated electronic structure of SrO-terminated SrIrO3 in the monolayer limit exhibits a striking similarity to bulk Sr2IrO4, the broken octahedral symmetry at the IrO2-terminated surface would mix the otherwise crystal field split e(g) and t(2g) states, resulting in distinctly different low-energy electronic states.

Here, we present detailed experimental evidence for this OAM-based origin of the Rashba effect by angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) and two-photon photoemission experiments for a monolayer AgTe on Ag(111). Using quantitative low-energy electron diffraction analysis, we determine the structural parameters and the stacking of the honeycomb overlayer with picometer precision. Based on an orbitalsymmetry analysis in ARPES and supported by first-principles calculations, we unequivocally relate the presence and absence of Rashba-type spin splittings in different bands of AgTe to the existence of OAM.},

In this work, we report on detailed transport experiments on compressively strained HgTe. Because of the superior sample quality in comparison to other topological semimetallic materials, this enables us to resolve the interplay of topological surface states and semimetallic bulk states to an unprecedented degree of precision and complexity. As our gate design allows us to precisely tune the Fermi level at the Weyl and Dirac points, we identify a magnetotransport regime dominated by Weyl/Dirac bulk state conduction for small carrier densities and by topological surface state conduction for larger carrier densities.

Based on density-functional theory calculations and symmetry-based model building including the role of correlations and substrate support, we develop an effective electronic model for WTe2 that fundamentally differs from other prototypical QSH settings: we find a remarkably strong transverse localization of QSH edge modes in WTe2 related to the glide symmetry due to which the topological gap opens away from high-symmetry points in momentum space. While the indirect bulk gap is much smaller, a large direct gap of up to 1 eV in the Brillouin zone region of the dispersing edge modes determines their properties.},

We reveal that such a system exhibits several intriguing properties resulting from the complex interplay of exchange interaction, electric polarization, and spin-orbit coupling. Despite a rather strong interfacial hybridization between Fe and GeTe bands, resulting in a complete suppression of the surface states of the latter, the bulk Rashba bands are hardly altered by the ferromagnetic overlayer.

Inspired by the original proposal for QSHE in graphene, several heterostructures have been synthesized, aiming at a hexagonal monolayer of heavier group IV elements promoting the QSHE bulk gap via increased spin-orbit coupling. So far, the monolayer/substrate coupling, which can manifest itself in strain, deformation, and hybridization, has proven to be detrimental to the aspired QSHE conditions for the monolayer. For stanene, the Sn analog of graphene, we investigate how an interposing buffer layer mediates between monolayer and substrate in order to optimize the QSHE setting. From a detailed density functional theory study, we highlight the principal mechanisms induced by such a buffer layer to accomplish quasifreestanding stanene in its QSHE phase. We complement our theoretical predictions by presenting attempts to grow a buffer layer on SiC(0001) on which stanene can be deposited.},

	abstract = {Sufficiently disordered metals display systematic deviations from the behavior predicted by semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Here the scattering events from impurities or thermal excitations can no longer be considered as additive-independent processes, as asserted by Matthiessen's rule following from this picture. In the intermediate region between the regime of good conduction and that of insulation, one typically finds a change of sign of the temperature coefficient of resistivity, even at elevated temperature spanning ambient conditions, a phenomenology that was first identified by Mooij in 1973. Traditional weak coupling approaches to identify relevant corrections to the Boltzmann picture focused on long-distance interference effects such as "weak localization", which are especially important in low dimensions (1D and 2D) and close to the zero-temperature limit. Here we formulate a strong-coupling approach to tackle the interplay of strong disorder and lattice deformations (phonons) in bulk three-dimensional metals at high temperatures. We identify a polaronic mechanism of strong disorder renormalization, which describes how a lattice locally responds to the relevant impurity potential. This mechanism, which quantitatively captures the Mooij regime, is physically distinct and unrelated to Anderson localization, but realizes early seminal ideas of Anderson himself, concerning the interplay of disorder and lattice deformations.},

Here, by combining high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first principles calculations (with and without spin-orbit coupling), the electronic structure of the rutile binary iridate, IrO2, is investigated. The detailed study of electronic bands measured on a high-quality single crystalline sample and use of a wide range of photon energy provide a huge improvement over the previous studies. The excellent agreement between theory and experimental results shows that the single-particle DFT description of IrO2 band structure is adequate, without the need of invoking any treatment of correlation effects. Although many observed features point to a 3D nature of the electronic structure, clear surface effects are revealed. The discussion of the orbital character of the relevant bands crossing the Fermi level sheds light on spin-orbit-coupling-driven phenomena in this material, unveiling a spin-orbit-induced avoided crossing, a property likely to play a key role in its large spin Hall effect.},

Recently, GeTe has been theoretically proposed as the father compound of a new class of materials, namely ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors. They display bulk bands with giant Rashba-like splitting due to the inversion symmetry breaking arising from the ferroelectric polarization, thus allowing for the ferroelectric control of the spin. Here, we provide the experimental demonstration of the correlation between ferroelectricity and spin texture. A surface-engineering strategy is used to set two opposite predefined uniform ferroelectric polarizations, inward and outward, as monitored by piezoresponse force microscopy. Spin and angular resolved photoemission experiments show that these GeTe(111) surfaces display opposite sense of circulation of spin in bulk Rashba bands. Furthermore, we demonstrate the crafting of nonvolatile ferroelectric patterns in GeTe films at the nanoscale by using the conductive tip of an atomic force microscope. Based on the intimate link between ferroelectric polarization and spin in GeTe, ferroelectric patterning paves the way to the investigation of devices with engineered spin configurations.},

	abstract = {Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the pressure-dependent electronic structure and electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling for simple cubic phosphorus by performing first-principles calculations within the full potential linearized augmented plane-wave method. As a function of increasing pressure, our calculations show a valley feature in T-c, followed by an eventual decrease for higher pressures. We demonstrate that this T-c valley at low pressures is due to two nearby Lifshitz transitions, as we analyze the band-resolved contributions to the e-ph coupling. Below the first Lifshitz transition, the phonon hardening and shrinking of the gamma Fermi surface with s-orbital character results in a decreased Tc with increasing pressure. After the second Lifshitz transition, the appearance of delta Fermi surfaces with 3d-orbital character generate strong e-ph interband couplings in alpha delta and beta delta channels, and hence lead to an increase of T-c. For higher pressures, the phonon hardening finally dominates, and T-c decreases again. Our study reveals that the intriguing T-c valley discovered in experiment can be attributed to Lifshitz transitions, while the plateau of T-c detected at intermediate pressures appears to be beyond the scope of our analysis. This strongly suggests that aside from e-ph coupling, electronic correlations along with plasmonic contributions may be relevant for simple cubic phosphorus. Our findings hint at the notion that increasing pressure can shift the low-energy orbital weight towards d character, and as such even trigger an enhanced importance of orbital-selective electronic correlations despite an increase of the overall bandwidth.},

Complex oxides are a desirable materials platform for such devices, as they host delicate and tunable charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedoms. Here, using first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we identify an electric-field tunable MIT, RD effect, and Weyl semimetal in a known, charge-ordered, and polar relativistic oxide Ag2BiO3 at room temperature. Remarkably, a centrosymmetric BiO6 octahedral-breathing distortion induces a sizable spontaneous ferroelectric polarization through Bi3+/Bi5+ charge disproportionation, which stabilizes simultaneously the insulating phase. The continuous attenuation of the Bi3+/Bi5+ disproportionation obtained by applying an external electric field reduces the band gap and RD spin splitting and drives the phase transition from a ferroelectric RD insulator to a paraelectric Dirac semimetal, through a topological Weyl semimetal intermediate state. These findings suggest that Ag2BiO3 is a promising material for spin-orbitonic applications.},

	abstract = {ABX(3) (A = organic cation; B = Sn, Pb; and X = halogen) organohalide perovskites have recently attracted much attention for their photovoltaic applications. Such hybrid compounds are derived from the replacement of the inorganic monovalent metal element by an organic cation, for example, methylammonium ion (MA = CH3NH3) and formamidinium ion (FA = +HC(NH2)(2)). In particular, since the organic cations are polar, it is interesting to investigate their possible long-range ordering and the corresponding Rashba spin-split bands. In this work, by using density functional theory calculations, we estimate the ferroelectric polarization corresponding to a complete ordering of dipole moments for the optimized structures of 12 perovskite halides, with A = MA, FA; B = Pb, Sn; X = Cl, Br, I. The adiabatic path and functional mode analysis have been discussed for all cases. The calculated values of the polarization may be as high as a conventional inorganic ferroelectric compound, such as BaTiO3. The concomitant inversion symmetry breaking, coupled to the sizable spin-orbit coupling of Pb and Sn, results in a fairly large Rashba spin-splitting effect for both valence and conduction bands. We highlight a rather anisotropic dispersion of spin-orbit split bands which gives rise to different Rashba parameters in different directions perpendicular to the polar axis in k-space. Furthermore, we found a weak and positive correlation between the magnitude of polarization and relevant spin-split band parameters. Since the mechanism for enhanced carrier lifetime in 3D Rashba materials is connected to the reduced recombination rate due to the spin-forbidden transition, our study could aid in the understanding of the fundamental physics of organometal halide perovskites and the optimization and design of materials for better performance.},

	abstract = {A displacive-type mechanism, which accounts for the occurrence of ferroelectricity in most inorganic ferroelectrics, is rarely found in molecule-based ferroelectrics. Its role is often covered by the predominant order-disorder one. Herein, we report a lone-pair-electron-driven displacive-type ferroelectric organic-inorganic hybrid compound, [H(2)dmdap][SbCl5] ({\textless}bold{\textgreater}1{\textless}/bold{\textgreater}; dmdap = N,N-dimethyl-1,3-diaminopropane). The structure of {\textless}bold{\textgreater}1{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} features a typical zigzag chain of [SbCl5](infinity) containing cis-connected anionic octahedra. The compound undergoes a second-order paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition at 143 K (P2(1)/c {\textless}-{\textgreater} Pc) with a saturation polarization of 1.36 mu C.cm(-2) and a coercive field of 3.5 kV.cm(-1) at 119 K. Theoretical study discloses the ferroelectricity mainly originating from the relative displacements of the Sb and Cl ions in the crystal lattice, which are driven by the 5s(2) lone-pair electrons of the Sb-III center. Furthermore, on the basis of analysis, possible routes are suggested to enhance ferroelectric polarization in this class of compounds.},

	abstract = {In developing physical theories, analogical reasoning has been found to be very powerful, as attested by a number of important historical examples. An analogy between two apparently different phenomena, once established, allows one to transfer information and bring new concepts from one phenomenon to the other. Here, we discuss an important analogy between two widely different physical problems, namely, the Jahn-Teller distortion in molecular physics and the Rashba spin splitting in condensed matter physics. By exploring their conceptual and mathematical features and by searching for the counterparts between them, we examine the orbital texture in Jahn-Teller systems, as the counterpart of the spin texture of the Rashba physics, and put forward a possible way of experimentally detecting the orbital texture. Finally, we discuss the analogy by comparing the coexistence of linear Rashba+Dresselhaus effects and Jahn-Teller problems for specific symmetries, which allow for nontrivial spin and orbital textures, respectively.},

Boosted by the remarkable electronic and physical properties of two-dimensional materials such as graphene and topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides have recently received renewed attention. In this context, the anomalous bulk properties of semimetallic WTe2 have attracted considerable interest. Here we report angle-and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of WTe2 single crystals, through which we disentangle the role of W and Te atoms in the formation of the band structure and identify the interplay of charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Supported by first-principles calculations and high-resolution surface topography, we reveal the existence of a layer-dependent behaviour. The balance of electron and hole states is found only when considering at least three Te-W-Te layers, showing that the behaviour of WTe2 is not strictly two dimensional.},

The thermal studies show that EtANaFe undergoes a second-order phase transition at about 360 K. X-ray diffraction data revealed that the high-temperature structure is monoclinic, space group P2(1)/n, with dynamically disordered ethyl-ammonium (EtA(+)) cations. EtANaFe possesses a polar low-temperature structure with the space group Pn and, in principle, is ferroelectric below 360 K. Dielectric data show that the reciprocal of the real part of dielectric permittivity above and below the phase transition temperature follows the Curie-Weiss, as expected for a ferroelectric phase transition. Based on theoretical calculations, we estimated the polarization as (0.2, 0, 0.8) mu C cm(-2), i.e., lying within the ac plane. The obtained data also indicate that the driving force of the phase transition is ordering of EtA(+) cations. However, this ordering is accompanied by significant distortion of the metal formate framework.},

Using first-principles density functional theory, we have investigated the effect of strain on the compounds C(NH2)(3)Cr(HCOO)(3) and (CH3CH2NH3)Mn(HCOO)(3).

	abstract = {Electrostatic doping in materials can lead to various exciting electronic properties, such as metal-insulator transition and superconductivity, by altering the Fermi level position or introducing exotic phases. Cd3As2, a three-dimensional (3D) analog of graphene with extraordinary carrier mobility, was predicted to be a 3D Dirac semimetal, a feature confirmed by recent experiments. However, most research so far has been focused on metallic bulk materials that are known to possess ultra-high mobility and giant magneto-resistance but limited carrier transport tunability. Here we report on the first observation of a gate-induced transition from band conduction to hopping conduction in single-crystalline Cd3As2 thin films via electrostatic doping by solid electrolyte gating. The extreme charge doping enables the unexpected observation of p-type conductivity in a similar to 50-nm-thick Cd3As2 thin film grown by molecular beam epitaxy. More importantly, the gate-tunable Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and the temperature-dependent resistance reveal a unique band structure and bandgap opening when the dimensionality of Cd3As2 is reduced. This is also confirmed by our first-principle calculations. The present results offer new insights toward nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications of Dirac semimetals in general and provide new routes in the search for the intriguing quantum spin Hall effect in low-dimension Dirac semimetals, an effect that is theoretically predicted but not yet experimentally realized.},

Indeed, density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicate that the reconstructed GeTe(0001)-(root 3 x root 3)R30 degrees structure is energetically competing with the GeTe(0001)-(1 x 1) reconstruction.

Suppression of rotational twist and reduction of twinned domains are achieved. The formation of rotational domains in GeTe grown on Si(111)-(7 x 7) is explained by domain matched coincidence lattice formation with the Si(111)-(1 x 1) surface.

Using density functional theory simulations and symmetry analysis, we show that the lead-free perovskite iodide (FA) SnI3, containing the planar formamidinium cation FA, (NH2CHNH2)(+), is ferroelectric. In fact, the perpendicular arrangement of FA planes, leading to a 'weak' polarization, is energetically more stable than parallel arrangements of FA planes, being either antiferroelectric or 'strong' ferroelectric. Moreover, we show that the 'weak' and 'strong' ferroelectric states with the polar axis along different crystallographic directions are energetically competing. Therefore, at least at low temperatures, an electric field could stabilize different states with the polarization rotated by pi/4, resulting in a highly tunable ferroelectricity appealing for multistate logic. Intriguingly, the relatively strong spin-orbit coupling in noncentrosymmetric (FA)SnI3 gives rise to a co-existence of Rashba and Dresselhaus effects and to a spin texture that can be induced, tuned and switched by an electric field controlling the ferroelectric state.},

With the aim of elucidating the role of correlations in the microscopic interplay between ferroelectricity and magnetism in the interfacial region, we find that, compared to standard DFT approximations, Hubbard-like approaches and hybrid functionals do not qualitatively modify the physical origin behind magnetoelectric effects driven by interfacial orbital hybridization. Rather, more accurate treatments of correlations for both Fe/BaTiO3 and Co/BaTiO3 interfaces predict a stronger change of the interface magnetization upon switching the direction of polarization in the ferroelectric layer.},

Applying a combined approach of ab initio methods and dynamical mean-field theory, we investigate how interactions and double Dirac band topology conspire to form the electronic quantum state of Bi2CuO4. We derive a downfolded eight-band model of the pristine material at low energies around the Fermi level. By tuning the model parameters from the free band structure to the realistic strongly correlated regime, we find a persistence of the double Dirac dispersion until its constituting time-reversal symmetry is broken due to the onset of magnetic ordering at the Mott transition. Our calculations suggest that the double Dirac fermions in Bi2CuO4 can be restored by experimentally accessible hydrostatic pressures. In light of the growing attention to the topological quantum chemistry approach, our results on Bi2CuO4 show how many-body effects must be included beyond the static mean-field level for reliable predictions on new materials.},

For strong disorder, even a modest electron-phonon interaction is found to dramatically renormalize the random potential, opening a mobility gap at the Fermi energy. This process, which reflects disorder-enhanced polaron formation, is here given a microscopic basis by treating the lattice deformations and Anderson localization effects on the same footing. We identify an intermediate “bad insulator” transport regime which displays resistivity values exceeding the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit and with a negative temperature coefficient, as often observed in strongly disordered metals. Our calculations reveal that this behavior originates from significant temperature-induced rearrangements of electronic states due to enhanced interaction effects close to the disorder-driven metal-insulator transition.},

We report a band dispersion in the reciprocal direction perpendicular to the layers, implying that electrons can also travel coherently when crossing from one layer to the other. The measured Fermi surface is characterized by two well-separated electron and hole pockets at either side of the Γ point, differently from previous more surface sensitive angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments that additionally found a pronounced quasiparticle weight at the zone center.

We show that such polar displacements arise from rotation and/or tilting octahedral distortions—cooperatively acting at the twin wall in both considered systems—rather than from a proper secondary ferroelectric instability, as often believed. Our results are in excellent agreement with experimental observations of domain walls in CaTiO3. In addition, we show that magnetic properties at the twin wall in CaMnO3 are also modified, thus suggesting an unexplored route to achieve and detect multiferroic ordering in a single-phase material.},

These materials satisfy mirror symmetries that are needed to sustain topologically protected surface states, at variance with time-reversal symmetry that is responsible for gapless edge states in Z2 topological insulators. The band inversions at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone that are related by mirror symmetry are brought about by an “asymmetric” hybridization between cation and anion sp orbitals. By working out the microscopic conditions to be fulfilled in order to maximize this hybridization, we identify materials in the rocksalt chalcogenide class that are prone to undergo a topological phase transition induced by pressure and/or alloying. Our model analysis is fully confirmed by complementary advanced first-principles calculations and ab initio-based tight-binding simulations.},

As the substrate turns superconducting, an intriguing situation emerges where pair breaking due to the adatom spins leads to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states, but also intertwines with Kondo phenomena. Through scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we analyze the interdependence of Kondo screening and superconductivity. Our data obtained on single Fe adatoms on Nb(110) show that the coupling and the resulting YSR states are strongly adsorption site-dependent and reveal a quantum phase transition at a Kondo temperature comparable to the superconducting gap. The experimental signatures are rationalized by combined density-functional theory and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations to rigorously treat magnetic and hybridization effects on equal footing.},

            Since the early days of Dirac flux quantization, magnetic monopoles have been sought after as a potential corollary of quantized electric charge. As opposed to magnetic monopoles embedded into the theory of electromagnetism, Weyl semimetals (WSM) exhibit Berry flux monopoles in reciprocal parameter space. As a function of crystal momentum, such monopoles locate at the crossing point of spin-polarized bands forming the Weyl cone. Here, we report momentum-resolved spectroscopic signatures of Berry flux monopoles in TaAs as a paradigmatic WSM. We carried out angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy at bulk-sensitive soft X-ray energies (SX-ARPES) combined with photoelectron spin detection and circular dichroism. The experiments reveal large spin- and orbital-angular-momentum (SAM and OAM) polarizations of the Weyl-fermion states, resulting from the broken crystalline inversion symmetry in TaAs. Supported by first-principles calculations, our measurements image signatures of a topologically non-trivial winding of the OAM at the Weyl nodes and unveil a chirality-dependent SAM of the Weyl bands. Our results provide directly bulk-sensitive spectroscopic support for the non-trivial band topology in the WSM TaAs, promising to have profound implications for the study of quantum-geometric effects in solids.},

Key to engineer the topologically non-trivial band ordering and sizable band gaps is strong spin-orbit interaction. Following Kane and Mele’s original suggestion, one approach is to synthesize monolayers of heavy atoms with honeycomb coordination accommodated on templates with hexagonal symmetry. Yet, in the majority of cases, this recipe leads to triangular lattices, typically hosting metals or trivial insulators. Here, we conceive and realize “indenene”, a triangular monolayer of indium on SiC exhibiting non-trivial valley physics driven by local spin-orbit coupling, which prevails over inversion-symmetry breaking terms. By means of tunneling microscopy of the 2D bulk we identify the quantum spin Hall phase of this triangular lattice and unveil how a hidden honeycomb connectivity emerges from interference patterns in Bloch px ± ipy-derived wave functions.},

In this study, angle-resolved photo-electron spectroscopy (ARPES) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are used, supported by density functional theory (DFT), to follow the formation and the evolution of the 2DEG in TiO2 thin films. Unlike other TMO systems, it is revealed that, once the anatase fingerprint is present, the 2DEG in TiO2 is robust and stable down to a single-unit-cell, and that the electron filling of the 2DEG increases with thickness and eventually saturates. These results prove that no critical thickness triggers the occurrence of the 2DEG in anatase TiO2 and give insight in formation mechanism of electronic states at the surface of TMO.},

Such a mechanism provides an invaluable tuning knob to alter the correlation profile in the kagome metal, and suggests itself for further experimental investigation.

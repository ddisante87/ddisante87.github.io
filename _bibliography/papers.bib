	abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) offers a desirable balance between quantitative accuracy and computational efficiency in practical many-electron calculations. Its central component, the exchange-correlation energy functional, has been approximated with increasing levels of complexity ranging from strictly local approximations to nonlocal and orbital dependent expressions with many tuned parameters. In this paper, we formulate a general way of rewriting complex density functionals using deep neural networks in a way that allows for simplified computation of Kohn-Sham potentials as well as higher functional derivatives through automatic differentiation, enabling access to highly nonlinear response functions and forces. These goals are achieved by using a recently developed class of robust neural network models capable of modeling functionals, as opposed to functions, with explicitly enforced spatial symmetries. Functionals treated in this way are then called global density approximations and can be seamlessly integrated with existing DFT workflows. Tests are performed for a dataset featuring a large variety of molecular structures and popular meta‚Äìgeneralized gradient approximation density functionals, where we successfully eliminate orbital dependencies coming from the kinetic energy density, and discover a high degree of transferability to a variety of physical systems. The presented framework is general and could be extended to more complex orbital and energy dependent functionals as well as refined with specialized datasets.},

	abstract = {A one-third monolayer of the heavy metals Sn and Pb deposited on semiconductor substrates can lead to a ‚àö3√ó‚àö3 surface reconstruction, constituting an exciting triangular lattice material platform. A long history of experiments identified charge-ordered and magnetic ground states. These discoveries were accompanied by a decades-long debate of whether electron correlations or other effects involving phonons are the driving force of the symmetry-broken states. The most recent discovery of superconductivity in boron-doped Sn/Si(111) with a ùëáùëê between 5 and 9 K led to a renewed excitement. Here we revisit the electronic and phononic properties of Sn and Pb adatom triangular lattices on Si(111) and SiC(0001). For all materials, we compute relativistic band structures using density functional theory (DFT)+ùëà, where ùëà is only applied to the substrate atoms in order to adjust the band gap to match the experimental value; as a consequence, some of the resulting tight-binding parameters of the metallic surface band substantially differ compared to previous studies. Remarkably, for Pb/SiC(0001), we predict Rashba spin-orbit coupling as large as 45\% of the nearest-neighbor hopping energy. In addition, we compute the phonon spectra and electron-phonon coupling constants for all materials, and for Pb/Si(111) even relativistically, although the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling has surprisingly little effect on the electron-phonon coupling constant. We conclude that the resulting couplings are too weak to account for electron-phonon-mediated superconductivity in any of these materials.},

Among the kagome metals, S‚Å¢c‚Å¢V6‚Å¢S‚Å¢n6 hosts an unconventional CDW, with its electronic order showing a different periodicity from the leading lattice instability. In this material, a CDW-softened flat phonon band has a second-order collapse at the same time that the first-order transition occurs. This phonon band originates from the out-of-plane vibrations of the Sc and Sn atoms, and it is at the base of the electron-phonon-coupling driven CDW phase of S‚Å¢c‚Å¢V6‚Å¢S‚Å¢n6. Here we use uniaxial strain to tune the frequency of the CDW amplitude mode, which originates from the collapse of the flat phonon band, tracking its evolution via time-resolved optical spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. Our findings emphasize the capability to induce an enhancement of the unconventional CDW properties in S‚Å¢c‚Å¢V6‚Å¢S‚Å¢n6 kagome metal through control of strain.},

This paper explores an interpretable data-driven approach utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoder neural networks to compress the two-particle vertex, a key element in Feynman diagram approaches. We show that the linear PCA offers more physical insight and better out-of-distribution generalization than the nominally more expressive autoencoders. Even with ‚àº10‚Äì20 principal components, we find excellent reconstruction across the phase diagram suggesting the existence of heretofore unrealized structures in the diagrammatic theory. We show that the principal components needed to describe the ferromagnetic state are not contained in the low rank description of the Fermi liquid (FL) state, unlike those for antiferromagnetic and superconducting states, suggesting that the latter two states emerge from pre-existing fluctuations in the FL while ferromagnetism is driven by a different process.},

In this study, through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide comprehensive spectroscopic measurements of the electronic responses induced by compressive and tensile strains on the charge-density-wave (CDW) and van Hove singularity (VHS) in CsV3Sb5. We observe a tripling of the CDW gap magnitudes with ¬†{\textasciitilde}¬†1\% strain. Simultaneously, changes of both energy and mass of the VHS are observed. Combined, this reveals an anticorrelation between the unconventional CDW order parameter and the mass of the VHS, and highlight the role of the latter in the superconducting pairing.

However, developing a functional device requires rapid, large-scale screening methods to evaluate the quality of the intercalant, which to date can be monitored only by slow, ultra-high vacuum-based surface science techniques. In this study, we utilize ex situ Raman micro-spectroscopy to optically and nondestructively identify the quantum spin Hall insulator indenene, a monolayer of indium sandwiched between a SiC(0001) substrate and a single sheet of graphene. Color modulation combined with indenene's distinctive low-frequency Raman fingerprint enables rapid assessment of its homogeneity and crystalline quality. Density functional perturbation theory indicates that this Raman signature originates mainly from indenene's shear and breathing modes, while additional higher order modes are tentatively attributed to defect-assisted and two-phonon Raman processes.},

Leveraging the principles of signal processing and data compression, this paper explores the wavelet decomposition as a versatile and efÔ¨Åcient method for obtaining compact and resourceefÔ¨Åcient representations of the many-body theory of interacting systems. The effectiveness of the wavelet decomposition is illustrated through its application to the representation of generalized susceptibilities and self-energies in a prototypical interacting fermionic system, namely the Hubbard model at half-Ô¨Ålling in its atomic limit. These results are the Ô¨Årst proof-of-principle application of the wavelet compression within the realm of many-body physics and demonstrate the potential of this wavelet-based compression scheme for understanding the physics of correlated electron systems.},

These measurements provide a direct observation of a magnetic field-controlled orbital Zeeman coupling to the orbital magnetic moments of up to 200 Bohr magnetons near the gapped Dirac points. Our work provides direct insight into the momentum-dependent nature of topological orbital moments
and their tunability via the magnetic field, concomitant with the evolution of the spin Berry curvature.

First-principle analysis shows the Li substitution to stabilize the insulating ground state, but only if antiferromagnetic correlations are present. Li further induces substitutional disorder and a 2D electron glass behavior in charge transport, reflected in a large 530 meV Coulomb gap and a linear suppression of VB spectral weight at EF that is observed by ARPES. Surprisingly, the disorder leaves the Cu(II)-derived ZRS largely unaffected. This indicates a local segregation of Li and Cu atoms onto the two separate corner-sharing Cu(II)O2 sub-lattices of the edge-sharing Cu(II)O planes, and highlights the ubiquitous resilience of the entangled two hole ZRS entity against impurity scattering.},

Here, we use the kagome metal ScV6Sn6 as a platform to investigate this problem, since it features both a kagome-derived nested Fermi surface and van-Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and a charge-ordered phase that strongly affects its physical properties. By combining time-resolved reflectivity, first principles calculations and photo-emission experiments, we identify the structural degrees of freedom to play a fundamental role in the stabilization of charge order, indicating that ScV6Sn6 features an instance of charge order predominantly originating from phonons.},

Even though important examples of topological Mott insulators have been constructed, the relevance of the underlying non-interacting band topology to the physics of the Mott phase has remained unexplored. Here, we show that the momentum structure of the Green‚Äôs function zeros defining the ‚ÄúLuttinger surface" provides a topological characterization of the Mott phase related, in the simplest description, to the one of the single-particle electronic dispersion. Considerations on the zeros lead to the prediction of new phenomena: a topological Mott insulator with an inverted gap for the bulk zeros must possess gapless zeros at the boundary, which behave as a form of ‚Äútopological antimatter‚Äù annihilating conventional edge states. Placing band and Mott topological insulators in contact produces distinctive observable signatures at the interface, revealing the otherwise spectroscopically elusive Green‚Äôs function zeros.},

By combining micro-ARPES and first-principles calculations, we measure the energy-momentum spectra and the Fermi surfaces of Co3Sn2S2 for different surface terminations and show the existence of topological features depending on the top-layer electronic environment. Our work helps to define a route for controlling bulk-derived topological properties by means of surface electrostatic potentials, offering a methodology for using Weyl kagome metals in responsive magnetic spintronics.},

It is debated whether the XV6Sn6 kagome family (where X is a rare-earth element), a recently discovered family of bilayer kagome metals, hosts a topologically non-trivial ground state resulting from the opening of spin‚Äìorbit coupling gaps. These states would carry a finite spin Berry curvature, and topological surface states. Here we investigate the spin and electronic structure of the XV6Sn6 kagome family. We obtain evidence for a finite spin Berry curvature contribution at the centre of the Brillouin zone, where the nearly flat band detaches from the dispersing Dirac band because of spin‚Äìorbit coupling. In addition, the spin Berry curvature is further investigated in the charge density wave regime of ScV6Sn6 and it is found to be robust against the onset of the temperature-driven ordered phase. Utilizing the sensitivity of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to the spin and orbital angular momentum, our work unveils the spin Berry curvature of topological kagome metals and helps to define its spectroscopic fingerprint.},

The calculation of the phonon dispersions and electron-phonon coupling suggests a strong similarity between LaRh3B2 and AV3Sb5 (A=K,Cs,Rb). For LaRh3B2, it matches quantitatively with the observed Tc, supporting a conventional phonon-mediated pairing mechanism.

This is particularly reflected by the rich physics of excitons in atomically thin crystals which uniquely arises from the interplay of strong Coulomb correlation, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and lattice geometry. Here we extend the field by reporting the observation of room temperature excitons in a material of non-trivial global topology. We study the fundamental optical excitation spectrum of a single layer of bismuth atoms epitaxially grown on a SiC substrate (hereafter bismuthene or Bi/SiC) which has been established as a large-gap, two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator. Strongly developed optical resonances are observed to emerge around the direct gap at the K and K‚Äô points of the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of bound excitons with considerable oscillator strength. These experimental findings are corroborated, concerning both the character of the excitonic resonances as well as their energy scale, by ab-initio GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations, confirming strong Coulomb interaction effects in these optical excitations. Our observations provide evidence of excitons in a 2D QSH insulator at room temperature, with excitonic and topological physics deriving from the very same electronic structure.},

However, it is not yet understood how the distinctive electronic structure of the kagome lattice is linked to the observed many-body phenomena. Here we combine angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory to reveal multiple kagome-derived van Hove singularities (vHS) coexisting near the Fermi level of CsV3Sb5 and analyse their contribution to electronic symmetry breaking. The vHS are characterized by two distinct sublattice flavours (p-type and m-type), which originate, respectively, from their pure and mixed sublattice characters. These twofold vHS flavours of the kagome lattice critically determine the pairing symmetry and unconventional ground states emerging in the AV3Sb5 series. We establish that, among the multiple vHS in CsV3Sb5, the m-type vHS of the dxz/dyz kagome band and the p-type vHS of the dxy/dx2‚Äìy2 kagome band are located very close to the Fermi level, setting the stage for electronic symmetry breaking. The former band is characterized by pronounced Fermi surface nesting, while the latter exhibits a higher-order vHS.

In particular, we find that in Scandium Herbertsmithite, the fine-structure constant, which measures the effective Coulomb interaction, is enhanced by a factor of about 3.2 as compared to graphene. We employ holography to estimate the ratio of the shear viscosity over the entropy density in Sc-Herbertsmithite, and find it about three times smaller than in graphene. These findings put the turbulent flow regime described by holography within the reach of experiments. Viscous electron fluids are predicted in strongly correlated systems but remain challenging to realize. Here, the authors predict enhanced effective Coulomb interaction and reduced ratio of the shear viscosity over entropy density in a Kagome metal, inferring turbulent flow of viscous electron fluids.},

Contrary to the expected conservation of the perovskite stacking order in the (001) direction, heteroepitaxially grown SrIrO3 films on TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 are found to exhibit a terminating SrO surface layer. The proposed mechanism for the self-organized conversion involves the adsorption of excess oxygen ions at the apical sites of the IrO2-terminated surface and the subsequent decomposition of the IrO6 octahedra into gaseous molecular IrO3 and the remaining SrO-terminated surface. Whereas the ab initio calculated electronic structure of SrO-terminated SrIrO3 in the monolayer limit exhibits a striking similarity to bulk Sr2IrO4, the broken octahedral symmetry at the IrO2-terminated surface would mix the otherwise crystal field split e(g) and t(2g) states, resulting in distinctly different low-energy electronic states.

It has been proposed that the formation of Rashba-type spin splittings originates microscopically from the existence of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the Bloch wave functions. Here, we present detailed experimental evidence for this OAM-based origin of the Rashba effect by angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) and two-photon photoemission experiments for a monolayer AgTe on Ag(111). Using quantitative low-energy electron diffraction analysis, we determine the structural parameters and the stacking of the honeycomb overlayer with picometer precision. Based on an orbitalsymmetry analysis in ARPES and supported by first-principles calculations, we unequivocally relate the presence and absence of Rashba-type spin splittings in different bands of AgTe to the existence of OAM.},

While easily accessible from a theoretical viewpoint, these topological semimetals pose a serious challenge in terms of experimental synthesis and analysis to allow for their unambiguous identification. In this work, we report on detailed transport experiments on compressively strained HgTe. Because of the superior sample quality in comparison to other topological semimetallic materials, this enables us to resolve the interplay of topological surface states and semimetallic bulk states to an unprecedented degree of precision and complexity. As our gate design allows us to precisely tune the Fermi level at the Weyl and Dirac points, we identify a magnetotransport regime dominated by Weyl/Dirac bulk state conduction for small carrier densities and by topological surface state conduction for larger carrier densities. As such, similar to topological insulators, HgTe provides the archetypical reference for the experimental investigation of topological semimetals.},

Whether it is a necessity of synthesis or a desired feature for application purposes, most 2D materials demand a supporting substrate. In this Rapid Communication, by combining ab initio simulations with multiorbital functional renormalization group analysis of Fermi surface instabilities, we highlight the constructive impact of substrates to enable the realization of exotic electronic quantum states of matter, where the buckling emerges as the decisive material parameter adjustable by the commensuration. At the example of germanene deposited on MoS2, an experimentally characterized superstructure, we find that the coupling between the monolayer and the substrate, together with the buckled hexagonal geometry, conspire to provide a highly suited scenario for unconventional triplet superconductivity.},

So far, the monolayer/substrate coupling, which can manifest itself in strain, deformation, and hybridization, has proven to be detrimental to the aspired QSHE conditions for the monolayer. For stanene, the Sn analog of graphene, we investigate how an interposing buffer layer mediates between monolayer and substrate in order to optimize the QSHE setting. From a detailed density functional theory study, we highlight the principal mechanisms induced by such a buffer layer to accomplish quasifreestanding stanene in its QSHE phase.

	abstract = {Sufficiently disordered metals display systematic deviations from the behavior predicted by semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Here the scattering events from impurities or thermal excitations can no longer be considered as additive-independent processes, as asserted by Matthiessen's rule following from this picture. In the intermediate region between the regime of good conduction and that of insulation, one typically finds a change of sign of the temperature coefficient of resistivity, even at elevated temperature spanning ambient conditions, a phenomenology that was first identified by Mooij in 1973. Traditional weak coupling approaches to identify relevant corrections to the Boltzmann picture focused on long-distance interference effects such as "weak localization", which are especially important in low dimensions (1D and 2D) and close to the zero-temperature limit. Here we formulate a strong-coupling approach to tackle the interplay of strong disorder and lattice deformations (phonons) in bulk three-dimensional metals at high temperatures. We identify a polaronic mechanism of strong disorder renormalization, which describes how a lattice locally responds to the relevant impurity potential. This mechanism, which quantitatively captures the Mooij regime, is physically distinct and unrelated to Anderson localization, but realizes early seminal ideas of Anderson himself, concerning the interplay of disorder and lattice deformations.},

The detailed study of electronic bands measured on a high-quality single crystalline sample and use of a wide range of photon energy provide a huge improvement over the previous studies. The excellent agreement between theory and experimental results shows that the single-particle DFT description of IrO2 band structure is adequate, without the need of invoking any treatment of correlation effects. Although many observed features point to a 3D nature of the electronic structure, clear surface effects are revealed. The discussion of the orbital character of the relevant bands crossing the Fermi level sheds light on spin-orbit-coupling-driven phenomena in this material, unveiling a spin-orbit-induced avoided crossing, a property likely to play a key role in its large spin Hall effect.},

	abstract = {The electric and nonvolatile control of the spin texture in semiconductors would represent a fundamental step toward novel electronic devices combining memory and computing functionalities. Recently, GeTe has been theoretically proposed as the father compound of a new class of materials, namely ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors. They display bulk bands with giant Rashba-like splitting due to the inversion symmetry breaking arising from the ferroelectric polarization, thus allowing for the ferroelectric control of the spin. Here, we provide the experimental demonstration of the correlation between ferroelectricity and spin texture. A surface-engineering strategy is used to set two opposite predefined uniform ferroelectric polarizations, inward and outward, as monitored by piezoresponse force microscopy. Spin and angular resolved photoemission experiments show that these GeTe(111) surfaces display opposite sense of circulation of spin in bulk Rashba bands. Furthermore, we demonstrate the crafting of nonvolatile ferroelectric patterns in GeTe films at the nanoscale by using the conductive tip of an atomic force microscope. Based on the intimate link between ferroelectric polarization and spin in GeTe, ferroelectric patterning paves the way to the investigation of devices with engineered spin configurations.},

	abstract = {Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the pressure-dependent electronic structure and electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling for simple cubic phosphorus by performing first-principles calculations within the full potential linearized augmented plane-wave method. As a function of increasing pressure, our calculations show a valley feature in T-c, followed by an eventual decrease for higher pressures. We demonstrate that this T-c valley at low pressures is due to two nearby Lifshitz transitions, as we analyze the band-resolved contributions to the e-ph coupling. Below the first Lifshitz transition, the phonon hardening and shrinking of the gamma Fermi surface with s-orbital character results in a decreased Tc with increasing pressure. After the second Lifshitz transition, the appearance of delta Fermi surfaces with 3d-orbital character generate strong e-ph interband couplings in alpha delta and beta delta channels, and hence lead to an increase of T-c. For higher pressures, the phonon hardening finally dominates, and T-c decreases again. Our study reveals that the intriguing T-c valley discovered in experiment can be attributed to Lifshitz transitions, while the plateau of T-c detected at intermediate pressures appears to be beyond the scope of our analysis. This strongly suggests that aside from e-ph coupling, electronic correlations along with plasmonic contributions may be relevant for simple cubic phosphorus. Our findings hint at the notion that increasing pressure can shift the low-energy orbital weight towards d character, and as such even trigger an enhanced importance of orbital-selective electronic correlations despite an increase of the overall bandwidth.},

Complex oxides are a desirable materials platform for such devices, as they host delicate and tunable charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedoms. Here, using first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we identify an electric-field tunable MIT, RD effect, and Weyl semimetal in a known, charge-ordered, and polar relativistic oxide Ag2BiO3 at room temperature. Remarkably, a centrosymmetric BiO6 octahedral-breathing distortion induces a sizable spontaneous ferroelectric polarization through Bi3+/Bi5+ charge disproportionation, which stabilizes simultaneously the insulating phase. The continuous attenuation of the Bi3+/Bi5+ disproportionation obtained by applying an external electric field reduces the band gap and RD spin splitting and drives the phase transition from a ferroelectric RD insulator to a paraelectric Dirac semimetal, through a topological Weyl semimetal intermediate state. These findings suggest that Ag2BiO3 is a promising material for spin-orbitonic applications.},

	abstract = {ABX(3) (A = organic cation; B = Sn, Pb; and X = halogen) organohalide perovskites have recently attracted much attention for their photovoltaic applications. Such hybrid compounds are derived from the replacement of the inorganic monovalent metal element by an organic cation, for example, methylammonium ion (MA = CH3NH3) and formamidinium ion (FA = +HC(NH2)(2)). In particular, since the organic cations are polar, it is interesting to investigate their possible long-range ordering and the corresponding Rashba spin-split bands. In this work, by using density functional theory calculations, we estimate the ferroelectric polarization corresponding to a complete ordering of dipole moments for the optimized structures of 12 perovskite halides, with A = MA, FA; B = Pb, Sn; X = Cl, Br, I. The adiabatic path and functional mode analysis have been discussed for all cases. The calculated values of the polarization may be as high as a conventional inorganic ferroelectric compound, such as BaTiO3. The concomitant inversion symmetry breaking, coupled to the sizable spin-orbit coupling of Pb and Sn, results in a fairly large Rashba spin-splitting effect for both valence and conduction bands. We highlight a rather anisotropic dispersion of spin-orbit split bands which gives rise to different Rashba parameters in different directions perpendicular to the polar axis in k-space. Furthermore, we found a weak and positive correlation between the magnitude of polarization and relevant spin-split band parameters. Since the mechanism for enhanced carrier lifetime in 3D Rashba materials is connected to the reduced recombination rate due to the spin-forbidden transition, our study could aid in the understanding of the fundamental physics of organometal halide perovskites and the optimization and design of materials for better performance.},

A minimal toy model and realistic tight-binding calculations identify them as spin-polarized flat bands connecting two Dirac points. This nontrivial origin provides the 1D midgap states with inherent stability and protects them from backscattering.

By exploring their conceptual and mathematical features and by searching for the counterparts between them, we examine the orbital texture in Jahn-Teller systems, as the counterpart of the spin texture of the Rashba physics, and put forward a possible way of experimentally detecting the orbital texture. Finally, we discuss the analogy by comparing the coexistence of linear Rashba+Dresselhaus effects and Jahn-Teller problems for specific symmetries, which allow for nontrivial spin and orbital textures, respectively.},

X-ray diffraction data revealed that the high-temperature structure is monoclinic, space group P2(1)/n, with dynamically disordered ethyl-ammonium (EtA(+)) cations. EtANaFe possesses a polar low-temperature structure with the space group Pn and, in principle, is ferroelectric below 360 K. Dielectric data show that the reciprocal of the real part of dielectric permittivity above and below the phase transition temperature follows the Curie-Weiss, as expected for a ferroelectric phase transition. Based on theoretical calculations, we estimated the polarization as (0.2, 0, 0.8) mu C cm(-2), i.e., lying within the ac plane.

In particular, MOFs with the same topology as inorganic perovskites have been shown to possess interesting properties, e.g., coexistence of ferroelectric and magnetic ordering. Using first-principles density functional theory, we have investigated the effect of strain on the compounds C(NH2)(3)Cr(HCOO)(3) and (CH3CH2NH3)Mn(HCOO)(3). Here, we show that compressive strain can substantially increase the ferroelectric polarization by more than 300\%, and we discuss the mechanism involved in the strain enhancement of polarization. Our study highlights the complex interplay between strain and organic cations' dipoles and put forward the possibility of tuning of ferroelectric polarization through appropriate thin film growing.},

	abstract = {Electrostatic doping in materials can lead to various exciting electronic properties, such as metal-insulator transition and superconductivity, by altering the Fermi level position or introducing exotic phases. Cd3As2, a three-dimensional (3D) analog of graphene with extraordinary carrier mobility, was predicted to be a 3D Dirac semimetal, a feature confirmed by recent experiments. However, most research so far has been focused on metallic bulk materials that are known to possess ultra-high mobility and giant magneto-resistance but limited carrier transport tunability. Here we report on the first observation of a gate-induced transition from band conduction to hopping conduction in single-crystalline Cd3As2 thin films via electrostatic doping by solid electrolyte gating. The extreme charge doping enables the unexpected observation of p-type conductivity in a similar to 50-nm-thick Cd3As2 thin film grown by molecular beam epitaxy. More importantly, the gate-tunable Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and the temperature-dependent resistance reveal a unique band structure and bandgap opening when the dimensionality of Cd3As2 is reduced. This is also confirmed by our first-principle calculations. The present results offer new insights toward nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications of Dirac semimetals in general and provide new routes in the search for the intriguing quantum spin Hall effect in low-dimension Dirac semimetals, an effect that is theoretically predicted but not yet experimentally realized.},

At growth onset, the rapid formation of fully relaxed crystalline GeTe(0001)-(1 x 1) is observed. During growth, a GeTe(0001)-(root 3 x root 3)R30 degrees surface reconstruction is also detected. Indeed, density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicate that the reconstructed GeTe(0001)-(root 3 x root 3)R30 degrees structure is energetically competing with the GeTe(0001)-(1 x 1) reconstruction.

Suppression of rotational twist and reduction of twinned domains are achieved. The formation of rotational domains in GeTe grown on Si(111)-(7 x 7) is explained by domain matched coincidence lattice formation with the Si(111)-(1 x 1) surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images show the coalescence of well-oriented islands with subnanometer roughness on their top part. van der Pauw measurements are performed to verify the electric properties of the films. The quality of epitaxial GeTe thin film is discussed and related to the crystalline structure of GeTe and its rhombohedrally distorted resonant bonds.},

Using density functional theory simulations and symmetry analysis, we show that the lead-free perovskite iodide (FA) SnI3, containing the planar formamidinium cation FA, (NH2CHNH2)(+), is ferroelectric. In fact, the perpendicular arrangement of FA planes, leading to a 'weak' polarization, is energetically more stable than parallel arrangements of FA planes, being either antiferroelectric or 'strong' ferroelectric. Moreover, we show that the 'weak' and 'strong' ferroelectric states with the polar axis along different crystallographic directions are energetically competing. Therefore, at least at low temperatures, an electric field could stabilize different states with the polarization rotated by pi/4, resulting in a highly tunable ferroelectricity appealing for multistate logic. Intriguingly, the relatively strong spin-orbit coupling in noncentrosymmetric (FA)SnI3 gives rise to a co-existence of Rashba and Dresselhaus effects and to a spin texture that can be induced, tuned and switched by an electric field controlling the ferroelectric state.},

Applying a combined approach of ab initio methods and dynamical mean-field theory, we investigate how interactions and double Dirac band topology conspire to form the electronic quantum state of Bi2CuO4. We derive a downfolded eight-band model of the pristine material at low energies around the Fermi level. By tuning the model parameters from the free band structure to the realistic strongly correlated regime, we find a persistence of the double Dirac dispersion until its constituting time-reversal symmetry is broken due to the onset of magnetic ordering at the Mott transition. Our calculations suggest that the double Dirac fermions in Bi2CuO4 can be restored by experimentally accessible hydrostatic pressures. In light of the growing attention to the topological quantum chemistry approach, our results on Bi2CuO4 show how many-body effects must be included beyond the static mean-field level for reliable predictions on new materials.},

	abstract = {We show that, in the presence of a deformable lattice potential, the nature of the disorder-driven metal-insulator transition is fundamentally changed with respect to the noninteracting (Anderson) scenario. For strong disorder, even a modest electron-phonon interaction is found to dramatically renormalize the random potential, opening a mobility gap at the Fermi energy. This process, which reflects disorder-enhanced polaron formation, is here given a microscopic basis by treating the lattice deformations and Anderson localization effects on the same footing. We identify an intermediate ‚Äúbad insulator‚Äù transport regime which displays resistivity values exceeding the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit and with a negative temperature coefficient, as often observed in strongly disordered metals. Our calculations reveal that this behavior originates from significant temperature-induced rearrangements of electronic states due to enhanced interaction effects close to the disorder-driven metal-insulator transition.},

We report a band dispersion in the reciprocal direction perpendicular to the layers, implying that electrons can also travel coherently when crossing from one layer to the other. The measured Fermi surface is characterized by two well-separated electron and hole pockets at either side of the Œì point, differently from previous more surface sensitive angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments that additionally found a pronounced quasiparticle weight at the zone center.

            Since the early days of Dirac flux quantization, magnetic monopoles have been sought after as a potential corollary of quantized electric charge. As opposed to magnetic monopoles embedded into the theory of electromagnetism, Weyl semimetals (WSM) exhibit Berry flux monopoles in reciprocal parameter space. As a function of crystal momentum, such monopoles locate at the crossing point of spin-polarized bands forming the Weyl cone. Here, we report momentum-resolved spectroscopic signatures of Berry flux monopoles in TaAs as a paradigmatic WSM. We carried out angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy at bulk-sensitive soft X-ray energies (SX-ARPES) combined with photoelectron spin detection and circular dichroism. The experiments reveal large spin- and orbital-angular-momentum (SAM and OAM) polarizations of the Weyl-fermion states, resulting from the broken crystalline inversion symmetry in TaAs. Supported by first-principles calculations, our measurements image signatures of a topologically non-trivial winding of the OAM at the Weyl nodes and unveil a chirality-dependent SAM of the Weyl bands. Our results provide directly bulk-sensitive spectroscopic support for the non-trivial band topology in the WSM TaAs, promising to have profound implications for the study of quantum-geometric effects in solids.},

	abstract = {Large-gap quantum spin Hall insulators are promising materials for room-temperature applications based on Dirac fermions. Key to engineer the topologically non-trivial band ordering and sizable band gaps is strong spin-orbit interaction. Following Kane and Mele‚Äôs original suggestion, one approach is to synthesize monolayers of heavy atoms with honeycomb coordination accommodated on templates with hexagonal symmetry. Yet, in the majority of cases, this recipe leads to triangular lattices, typically hosting metals or trivial insulators. Here, we conceive and realize ‚Äúindenene‚Äù, a triangular monolayer of indium on SiC exhibiting non-trivial valley physics driven by local spin-orbit coupling, which prevails over inversion-symmetry breaking terms. By means of tunneling microscopy of the 2D bulk we identify the quantum spin Hall phase of this triangular lattice and unveil how a hidden honeycomb connectivity emerges from interference patterns in Bloch px‚Äâ¬±‚Äâipy-derived wave functions.},

We adopt a minimal two-orbital eg model which covers cuprates and nickelate heterostructures in different parametric limits, and analyze its superconducting instabilities. The joint consideration of interactions, doping, fermiology, and in particular the eg orbital splitting allows us to explain the strongly differing pairing propensities in cuprate and nickelate superconductors.},

	abstract = {The formation and the evolution of electronic metallic states localized at the surface, commonly termed 2D electron gas (2DEG), represents a peculiar phenomenon occurring at the surface and interface of many transition metal oxides (TMO). Among TMO, titanium dioxide (TiO2), particularly in its anatase polymorph, stands as a prototypical system for the development of novel applications related to renewable energy, devices and sensors, where understanding the carrier dynamics is of utmost importance. In this study, angle-resolved photo-electron spectroscopy (ARPES) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are used, supported by density functional theory (DFT), to follow the formation and the evolution of the 2DEG in TiO2 thin films. Unlike other TMO systems, it is revealed that, once the anatase fingerprint is present, the 2DEG in TiO2 is robust and stable down to a single-unit-cell, and that the electron filling of the 2DEG increases with thickness and eventually saturates. These results prove that no critical thickness triggers the occurrence of the 2DEG in anatase TiO2 and give insight in formation mechanism of electronic states at the surface of TMO.},

	abstract = {From first-principles calculations, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of the kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A=Cs, K, Rb) under isotropic and anisotropic pressure. Charge-ordering patterns are found to be unanimously suppressed, while there is a significant rearrangement of p-type and m-type Van Hove point energies with respect to the Fermi level. Already for moderate tensile strain along the V plane and compressive strain normal to the V layer, we find that a Van Hove point can be shifted to the Fermi energy. Such a mechanism provides an invaluable tuning knob to alter the correlation profile in the kagome metal, and suggests itself for further experimental investigation. It might allow us to reconcile possible multidome superconductivity in kagome metals not only from phonons but also from the viewpoint of unconventional pairing.},

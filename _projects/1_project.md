Artificial intelligence and quantum materials are now revolutionizing the way we relate to the world. The first, in its machine learning and deep learning facets, is now present in every aspect of our lives, from smartphones to automation in our homes. Quantum materials, obeying the bizarre rules of quantum mechanics, promise instead to play a fundamental role in the field of new technologies and sustainable energies.

However, it is not easy to imagine a meeting point between these two revolutionary spheres. Nevertheless, more and more often in recent years, artificial intelligence and the quantum description of the world around us have intersected, thus giving rise to new methods for studying the microscopic behavior of matter.

Phenomena and properties such as magnetism and superconductivity owe their origin to the way elementary particles, electrons, interact with each other. The description of these interactions, and the phenomenologies that emerge from them, have occupied the minds of the best physicists for more than a century. Many theoretical models have thus been developed, but none of them has so far been able to give a definite answer to the "many electron problem".

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}

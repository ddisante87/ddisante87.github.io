> The kagome lattice has emerged as a prototypical playground for sought-after quantum phenomena of electronic matter. In fact, from the viewpoint of bandstructure and itinerant electrons, the kagome lattice offers a whole variety of appealing features. These range from Dirac cones and van Hove singularities to flat band, where the latter has been suggested as a natural host for ferromagnetism thanks to the quenching of kinetic energy and increase of the density of states, as well as for topological physics. Kagome Dirac cones, on the other hand, have become a paradigmatic tool to accomplish correlated Dirac fermions, possibly leading to hydrodynamic electron flows meeting the criteria for accessing the turbulent regime. Most recently, exotic electron instabilities have been reported at, or close to, van Hove filling, where the nesting properties of the kagome Fermi surface, combined with its sublattice interference, are preeminently suited for enhancing exotic two-particle effective interaction profiles.

Kagome systems represent an exciting direction of modern condensed matter physics, and here a list of my works in this field.

## Indenene: a triangular lattice with emerging honeycomb physics

We have conceived and realized a new quantum material: "Indenene". It consists of a single layer of the chemical element Indium, and enriches the family of the so-called topological insulators.

> The triangular lattice behind its tailor-made materials-design concept is not only novel in the context of topological quantum materials, but it also offers important advantages for future applications. Ever since the discovery of the first topological insulator, this class of materials has been attributed enormous potential for the development of future electronics going beyond state-of-the-art technology and possibly even for the realization of quantum computers.

The low-energy electronic properties of Indenene are well described by chiral orbitals on the triangular lattice sites. The honeycomb sublattice's physics originates from the peculiar inversion symmetry breaking
imposed by the underlying supporting substrate. The low-energy bandstructure, then, closely resembles that of heavy graphene, with a massive Dirac quasi-particle.

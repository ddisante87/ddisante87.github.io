I am an Associate Professor at the University of Bologna. I earned a B.S. in physics at the
University of L’Aquila in 2011 and a Ph.D. in physics in 2015. I
subsequently was a postdoctoral fellow and young group leader at the
Physics Department of the University of Würzburg (2016-2020), and a Marie
Curie Research Fellow at the Center for Computational Quantum Physics of the
Flatiron Institute in New York (2021-2023).

My research is focused on the numerical quantum simulations of the
electronic properties of interacting material
systems, with emphasis on topology and spin-orbit driven phenomena. I was
the principal investigator of an individual Marie Curie fellowship which
aims at using machine learning applications in condensed matter
problems.
